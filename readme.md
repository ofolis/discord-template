# discord-template

This is my command-oriented Discord bot template. It is a TypeScript Node.js project that can be run using Node or built into a binary distribution (bundled and released using GitHub actions).

Because I am using this template for my own Discord bot projects, it will be updated as those projects mature and are refined.
